# Exponentiation of a matrix
---

This application is based on Windows Forms technology. It allows you to raise a matrix to a degree. It uses a non-standard algorithm to calculate. This algorithm makes the calculations much faster. The algorithm is based on binary exponentiation and has been applied to matrices.

There are two variants of the code attached here:
1. For the console
2. For window application (OS Windows)
